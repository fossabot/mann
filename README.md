# Sections
Here are all the possible sections of a Linux man page, in their expected order:

Name

Synopsis

Configuration

Description

Options

Exit status

Return value

Errors

Environment

Files

Versions

Attributes

Conforming to

Notes

Bugs

Example

See Also

Generally, no man page will have all of these.


Beyond the sections within the pages, there’s the matter of manual order. When you read a man page or search for one online, you’ll see numbers in parentheses after the commands you’re looking up: sed(1), fdisk(8), exit(3), to name a few. These numbers refer to the physical manual and indicate where in said manual this man page would be, depending on what’s being described. Here’s the current Linux section structure:

General commands

System calls

Library functions, covering in particular the C standard library

Special files

File formats and conventions

Games and screensavers

Miscellanea

System administration commands and daemons

Once you know this, you’ll find the resource you’re looking for faster.
